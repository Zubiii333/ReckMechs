# 🔧 Railway Deployment Fix Guide

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Nixpacks Configuration Error**
- ❌ **Problem**: `invalid type: map, expected a sequence for key 'providers'`
- ✅ **Fixed**: Corrected `nixpacks.toml` syntax
- ✅ **Added**: Alternative `.nixpacks/plan.json` configuration

### 2. **PHP Project Detection**
- ✅ **Added**: `index.php` in root for Railway PHP detection
- ✅ **Added**: `build.sh` script for reliable building
- ✅ **Updated**: `railway.json` with proper configuration

## 📁 Files Created/Updated

```
✅ nixpacks.toml          (Fixed syntax)
✅ railway.json           (Simplified configuration)
✅ .nixpacks/plan.json    (Alternative config)
✅ build.sh               (Build script)
✅ index.php              (PHP detection helper)
✅ Procfile               (Start command)
```

## 🚀 Deployment Options

### Option 1: Standard Railway Deployment
1. **Commit changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Railway nixpacks configuration"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Redeploy on Railway** - Should now work without errors

### Option 2: Manual Configuration (If still failing)
In Railway dashboard:
- **Build Command**: `bash build.sh`
- **Start Command**: `php -S 0.0.0.0:$PORT -t . backend/server.php`
- **Root Directory**: `/` (leave empty)

### Option 3: Alternative Hosting
If Railway continues to have issues, try:
- **Heroku**: Works great with PHP
- **DigitalOcean App Platform**: Native PHP support
- **Render**: Good PHP support

## 🎯 Expected Build Process

Railway should now:
1. ✅ Detect PHP project (via `index.php` and `composer.json`)
2. ✅ Use PHP 8.2 runtime
3. ✅ Run `bash build.sh` (which runs composer install)
4. ✅ Start with PHP built-in server

## 🌐 URLs After Deployment

- Main: `https://your-app.railway.app/`
- Booking: `https://your-app.railway.app/book.html`
- Admin: `https://your-app.railway.app/admin.html`

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

If deployment still fails:
1. Check Railway logs for specific errors
2. Try deleting and recreating the Railway project
3. Use manual build/start commands in Railway settings
4. Consider alternative hosting platforms

The nixpacks configuration error should now be completely resolved! 🎉
